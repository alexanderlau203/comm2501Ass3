<p>Though the air pollution levels in America are improving with each year, there
is still work to be done! Some O3, NO2 and CO levels still spike high enough to
pose a threat to the community.</p>
<p>For policy makers and government officials, the insights should provide enough
information on the ‘where’ and ‘how’ concerning air pollution trends, in hope
for action and cleaner air. For everyday citizens (American or otherwise),
hopefully you’ve learnt a little bit more about pollution. Remember, even the
simplest things like taking a bus instead of a car can help everyone breath a
little easier!</p>
