Overall, air pollutants have been declining from the 2000s as due to better 
regulations, economic shifts and other technological innovations. However, air
quality constantly fluctuates and can pose health risks to people who are 
sensitive to air pollution, such as the elderly.  

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of air quality that is used in our data
set.

The EPA has also set some general guidelines for pollutant levels in the [NAAQS Table](https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table).
Below, four major pollutant trends have been summarised for the US as a whole:

The declines for NO2, SO2 and CO AQIs are promising, declining by approximately
15, 10 and 5 points respectively. However, ground-level ozone has largely 
remained the same around 38. While the graph shows a promising picture for the 
US overall, it's limitations lie in showing short-term peaks. However, the
line component of the graph shows mid-term peaks and troughs occurring due to
change in temperature that each season brings.

In the case of ozone, we see dramatic oscillations, which has a large standard
deviation of 10.24, peaking during cold periods. CO, SO2 and NO2 have the 
inverse relationship and peak around warmer periods.

Also note that some data from the following states are missing:  
- Montana  
- Idaho   
- South Carolina  
- West Virginia
- Nebraska
