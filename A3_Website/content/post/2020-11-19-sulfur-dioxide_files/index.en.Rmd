## SO2 Across the Nation

SO2 levels in the US are also very restrained, with 95% of the participating 
states below an AQI of 10 and the majority clustered below 5.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("leaflet")
library("RColorBrewer")
library("ggthemes")
library("plotly")
recent_data = read.csv("../recent_data.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data = recent_data %>%
  rename(SO2 = so2, AQI = so2_aqi)
data$AQI = round(data$AQI, 2)
data$SO2 = round(data$SO2, 4)

plot = ggplot(data=data, aes(label=State))+
  geom_point(aes(y=SO2, x=AQI), colour="purple3")+
  ggtitle('Average SO2 by US State in 2015')+ 
  labs(y='SO2 (Parts per billion)', x='SO2 AQI')+
  theme_economist()
ggplotly(plot)



```

The distribution of SO2 across the country doesn't seem to yield a particular
geographical pattern, only showing concentrations in Alaska and Ohio.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "Purples",
  domain = c(-5, 7))

recent_data %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(label = ~State,
                   popup = ~paste(round(so2, 4), 'parts per billion<br>AQI: ', 
                                  round(so2_aqi, 2)),
                   color = ~pal(so2),
                   opacity = 0.8,
                   radius = ~so2_aqi,
                   lng = ~Long,
                   lat = ~Lat) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal, 
            values = recent_data$so2, 
            position = "bottomright", 
            title = "SO2 (ppb)")

```

The distribution of concentrations is also fairly healthy. Even in the highest
producing SO2 states, there are only a few days in the year where the SO2 AQI
levels reach over 50. The only minor concern being Indiana, with quite a few
high AQI outliers.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
high_so2 = read.csv("highSo2.csv")

plot = ggplot(high_so2, aes(x=State, y=so2_aqi, fill=State))+ 
  geom_boxplot()+
  ggtitle('States with the Worst AQI in 2015')+ 
  labs(y='AQI', x='State')
ggplotly(plot)
```


## SO2 By Source
In the graph below, the greatest source of SO2 production comes from stationary
fuel combustion. However, from 2006-2015, this has drastically
improved, decreasing to almost a third of its original emissions output. The
remaining sources have remained the fairly stable and low over this period.
```{r, echo=FALSE}

data = read.csv('../byIndustry.csv')
plot = ggplot(data, aes(fill=Source, y=SO2, x=Year)) + 
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity")+
  labs(y='SO2 (Parts per billion)', x='Year', color='Pollutant')+
  ggtitle('Changes in SO2 Emissions By Source (2006 - 2015)')+ 
  theme_bw()
ggplotly(plot)
```
