## NO2 Across the Nation
In the most recent data set (2015), Colorado averaged the worst AQI at 36. It 
was also followed by like New York and Utah both at approximately 29.8. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("leaflet")
library("RColorBrewer")
library("ggthemes")
library("plotly")
recent_data = read.csv("../recent_data.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data = recent_data %>%
  rename(NO2 = no2, AQI = no2_aqi)
data$AQI = round(data$AQI, 2)
data$NO2 = round(data$NO2, 2)

plot = ggplot(data=data, aes(label=State))+
  geom_point(aes(y=NO2, x=AQI))+
  ggtitle('Average NO2 by US State in 2015')+ 
  labs(y='NO2 (Parts per billion)', x='NO2 AQI')+
  theme_economist()
ggplotly(plot)
```

Geographically, there appears to be two major concentrations of NO2. The first
being near just East of Central America involving Colarado, Utah and Arizona.
The second is locaetd on the East cost, involving more population dense areas
like New York and New Jersey. In the interactive chart below, click on the 
circles for the exact numbers for NO2 levels and AQI.
 
```{r,  echo=FALSE}
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "Greens",
  domain = recent_data$no2)

recent_data %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(label = ~State,
                   popup = ~paste(round(no2, 2), 'parts per billion<br>AQI: ', 
                                  round(no2_aqi, 2)),
                   color = ~pal(no2),
                   opacity = 0.8,
                   radius = ~no2_aqi,
                   lng = ~Long,
                   lat = ~Lat) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal, 
            values = recent_data$no2, 
            position = "bottomright", 
            title = "NO2 (ppb)")

```

Looking at the 4 worst states, the distribution of their daily NO2 AQI levels
show some worrying results.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
high_no2 = read.csv("highNo2.csv")
plot = ggplot(high_no2, aes(x=State, y=no2_aqi, fill=State))+ 
  geom_boxplot()+
  ggtitle('States with the Worst AQI in 2015')+ 
  labs(y='AQI', x='State')
ggplotly(plot)
```


In Colorado, most of the AQI measurements are concentrated around 45-50, which
puts that state at a 'moderate' health risk. In addition, Colorado, New Jersey 
and New York all show significant peaks on certain days, which come close to
the 'Unhealthy for sensitive groups' category (AQI of 100).

## NO2 By Source
Overall, transportation and stationary fuel combustion have reduced their
NO2 emissions greatly, in part to technology and innovation. Both have been
cut by a third between 2006 and 2015. However, emissions from industrial 
processes have increased slightly by 


```{r, echo=FALSE}

data = read.csv('../byIndustry.csv')

plot = ggplot(data, aes(fill=Source, y=NO2, x=Year)) + 
  geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity")+
  labs(y='NO2 (Parts per billion)', x='Year', color='Pollutant')+
  ggtitle('Changes in NO2 Emissions By Source (2006 - 2015)')+ 
  theme_bw()
ggplotly(plot)
```
