Recent studies have shown that air pollution is linked with mortality rates. 
While air pollution in the US has been steadily improving over the last decade,
almost 150 000 people could lose their lives from poor air quality in the next
10 years, if air quality remains the same.

Future Air is a data visualisation project, completed as part of UNSW's COMM2501 
course. However, it's purpose and objectives extend far beyond this. The data
visualisations reveal detailed insights into the location and sources of four
major air pollutants (sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide and 
ground-level ozone). It is this detail that can help drive decision making at
a government level, providing insights that compares to that of the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  

But Future Air also serves another purpose, by giving us the opportunity to 
inform American citizens about air polluting activities. Our aim is to
inspire action, given a better awareness of air pollutants and their dangers.
