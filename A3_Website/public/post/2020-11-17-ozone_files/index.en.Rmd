## O3 Across the Nation

Ozone is the only air pollutant that has not improved between 2000 and 2015.
This is reflected in our most recent data set, which shows the average ozone
AQI level reaching over 40 in 8 states. 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

```{r, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("leaflet")
library("RColorBrewer")
library("ggthemes")
library("plotly")
recent_data = read.csv("../recent_data.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data = recent_data %>%
  rename(O3 = o3, AQI = o3_aqi)
data$AQI = round(data$AQI, 2)
data$O3 = round(data$O3, 4)

plot = ggplot(data=data, aes(label=State))+
  geom_point(aes(y=O3, x=AQI), colour="royalblue4")+
  ggtitle('Average O3 by US State in 2015')+ 
  labs(y='O3 (Parts per million)', x='O3 AQI')+
  theme_economist()
ggplotly(plot)
```

Similar to NO2, the ozone seems to be concentrated on near Utah and the
surrounding states, as well as the major East Coast cities. Tenesee, however,
seems to be the exception to this trend.


```{r, echo=FALSE}

pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "Blues",
  domain = recent_data$o3)

recent_data %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(label = ~State,
                   popup = ~paste(round(o3, 4), 'parts per million<br>AQI: ', 
                                  round(o3_aqi, 2)),
                   color = ~pal(o3),
                   opacity = 0.8,
                   radius = ~o3_aqi,
                   lng = ~Long,
                   lat = ~Lat) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal, 
            values = recent_data$o3, 
            position = "bottomright", 
            title = "O3 (ppm)")

```

Examining the four worst states also shows alarmingly high AQI peaks.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
high_o3 = read.csv("highO3.csv")
plot = ggplot(high_o3, aes(x=State, y=o3_aqi, fill=State))+ 
  geom_boxplot()+
  ggtitle('States with the Worst AQI in 2015')+ 
  labs(y='AQI', x='State')
ggplotly(plot)
```

While the majority of readings stay under 50, there are several peaks in the 
moderate category. Meanwhile, peaks in Utah have approach the 'Unhealthy' 
category, in which some members of the general public may experience health 
effects.

## O3 By Source 

The data set does not include O3 by source as O3 is not directly produced
by humans. Rather, nitrous oxides and volatile organic compounds produced
by humans react together to create O3.
