Overall, air pollutants have been declining from the 2000s as due to better regulations, economic shifts and other technological innovations. However, air quality constantly fluctuates and can pose health risks to people who are sensitive to air pollution, such as the elderly.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of air quality that is used in our data set.</description>

      <description>Though the air pollution levels in America are improving with each year, there is still work to be done! Some O3, NO2 and CO levels still spike high enough to pose a threat to the community.
For policy makers and government officials, the insights should provide enough information on the ‘where’ and ‘how’ concerning air pollution trends, in hope for action and cleaner air. For everyday citizens (American or otherwise), hopefully you’ve learnt a little bit more about pollution.</description>
